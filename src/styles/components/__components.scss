// Components

// For smaller components, there is the components/ folder (frequently called modules/).
// While layout/ is kind of macro (defining the global wireframe), components/ is more micro.
// It can contain all kinds of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, or anything
// along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/ since your site is should
// be mostly composed of tiny modules.
