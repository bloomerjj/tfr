// The rules

// 1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in here.

// 2. Document all hacks fully:
//     1. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
//     2. Why was this needed?
//     3. How does this fix it?
//     4. How might you fix it properly, given more time?

// 3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.

// 4. Try and clean this up when you have some down time.
//     1. Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.

//
// 1. Element is in /src/markup/pages/index.pug
// 2. The container next to it has a very specific breakpoint and due that, starts separating the triangle from its icon-container.
// The "md" size already set fix the problem but makes the container looks weird in a lot of resolution span.
// 3. Taking the specific point, with a media query can be solved without generate another breakpoint system (something between sm and md)
@media screen and (max-width: 880px) {
    .purple-container {
        margin-left: auto !important;
    }
    .purple-triangle {
        display: none;
    }
}
